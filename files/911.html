The Design Conference Room is a media-enhanced conference facility and
laboratory supporting multi-disciplinary collaborative design. 
The DCR is an ordinary conference room with comfortable chairs around a
large table with plenty of space for spreading out papers and using
overhead projectors and whiteboards.<P>

<P>
The foremost difference is the use of computers as a supporting
extension of the physical medium used by conferees.  Six Macintosh
workstations are buried in side wings of the table, while the center
tabletop contains three large color monitors visible through glass
panels.  These central monitors, which show the same image to all users,
constitute a <I>public </I> digital workspace, with each user capable of
taking control 
via the DCR's unique Collaboration Network. 
<P>

Each user can view this public workspace and use his or her <I>private
</I> workstation while maintaining full visual contact with other
session participants. Users also have access to all campus-wide
computing resources via X-sessions or remote login as well as the full
resources of the Internet and World Wide Web via Netscape and other
applications.
